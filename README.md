# MutationAnalysis
The Scope of this project is to understand and analyze the mutation tools like PIT, MuJava, Major and implement it by using case study and Junit test cases generated by Evosuite.
The source file OrdSet.java and OverFlowException.java are in the package that is given along with this report. The folder will have all the documentation on instructions to configure Evosuite, Maven, PIT, Mujava software. If someone wants to replicate my work, there are multiple tutorial documents created to achieve those test results. All files related to Evosuite, Maven and PIT are in MAIN_PROJECT folder while Mujava files will be under MUJAVA folder.
